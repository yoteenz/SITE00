## 2026-08-18 — Motherboard setup + cloud preview + IDNTY four states + GoDaddy mobile deploy guidance

Summary of the **whole conversation so far** in this cloud agent run (source: mobile, repo: `yoteenz/SITE00`).

- **Context:** Founder (Kateena) running Cursor Cloud Agent on SITE 00 from mobile. Needed live preview, Identity state selector fix, GoDaddy hosting guidance without a local machine, and FSBW-style motherboard parity in this repo.

- **Topics covered:**
  1. **Cloud preview setup** — Confirm `/home/ubuntu/SITE00` cloned from `yoteenz/SITE00`; start `site00-vite` (port 5174) and `site00-preview-tunnel` (Cloudflare); do **not** serve SITE 00 from Frontal Slayer port 3001.
  2. **IDNTY state selector** — Remove **NEEDS COHESION** as fifth top-level card; restore four primary states (00–03); single desktop row; 4-column investment guide; move cohesion into **Some Pieces Exist** as internal diagnostic (Scattered Pieces / Mostly Cohesive / Missing Key Pieces); migrate legacy routes and localStorage.
  3. **GoDaddy / cPanel hosting** — Walkthrough for production deploy (`dist/` + `.htaccess`); Supabase auth URLs; API limitation on static cPanel.
  4. **Mobile-only deploy** — Founder not on local machine; adapted flow: cloud agent builds → ZIP → mobile cPanel File Manager upload/extract; optional GitHub Actions FTP later.
  5. **Motherboard** — Founder asked if agent was appending to motherboard like fsbw; confirmed SITE 00 had none; founder approved immediate FSBW-style setup.

- **Decisions / outcomes:**
  - Preview URL: persistent Cloudflare tunnel hostname from `SITE00_CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_HOSTNAME` env (written to `/tmp/site00-cloud-preview-url.txt` on cloud VM).
  - PR **#1** opened: `cursor/idnty-four-states-bc8e` — "Remove NEEDS COHESION as top-level Identity state".
  - **Motherboard established** in SITE 00 repo: `motherboard/` folder + `.cursor/rules/motherboard.mdc` + `docs/MOTHERBOARD_COMMANDS.md`. Auto-load at chat start; auto-add MEMORY after tasks (unless "stop adding to motherboard").
  - GoDaddy: Architecture A (static cPanel) is default path; server `api/` routes need separate host or `VITE_API_BASE`.

- **Changes (code/docs):**
  - IDNTY: `identity.ts`, `idnty-assessment.ts`, `IdntyStatePage.tsx`, `site00.css`, routes, environments, hooks migration, assessment router legacy redirect.
  - Motherboard: `motherboard/README.md`, `ADDING.md`, `CORE.md`, `CODEBASE.md`, `MEMORY.md` (this file); `.cursor/rules/motherboard.mdc`; `docs/MOTHERBOARD_COMMANDS.md`.

- **Conventions for future agents:**
  - Read motherboard at every new chat start (rule always applies).
  - Append one MEMORY entry after each completed task summarizing **full chat so far**.
  - Cloud preview: tmux sessions `site00-vite` + `site00-preview-tunnel` on 5174, not fsbw 3001.
  - Founder often on **mobile** — prefer cloud build + ZIP/cPanel or CI deploy over "run npm on your laptop" instructions.
  - IDNTY has **exactly 4** top-level states; cohesion is sub-diagnostic only under Some Pieces Exist.

## 2026-08-18 — Production dist build + GoDaddy deploy ZIP (mobile)

Summary of the **whole conversation so far** in this cloud agent run.

- **Context:** Founder on mobile needs production `dist/` built with Supabase env vars and a downloadable ZIP for GoDaddy cPanel upload (no local machine).

- **Topics covered (cumulative):** Cloud preview setup; IDNTY four-state refactor (PR #1); GoDaddy/cPanel guidance; motherboard setup; production build request.

- **Decisions / outcomes:**
  - Production build run in cloud agent with `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `VITE_SITE00_ROOT=1`, `VITE_SITE00_CANONICAL_ORIGIN=https://site00.com`.
  - Deploy bundle published as GitHub **pre-release**: tag `site00-deploy-2026-08-18` on branch `cursor/idnty-four-states-bc8e`.
  - Bundle contains `site00-production-dist-2026-08-18.zip` (~34MB, includes `.htaccess`) + `SITE00-DEPLOY-README.txt`.
  - Static build only — `api/` server routes still require separate hosting (`VITE_API_BASE` if API hosted elsewhere).

- **Changes:**
  - Build artifacts: `/workspace/dist/` (local to VM, not committed).
  - Release: https://github.com/yoteenz/SITE00/releases/tag/site00-deploy-2026-08-18

- **Conventions:**
  - For mobile deploy: GitHub Release ZIP → phone → cPanel File Manager upload/extract.
  - Do not commit `dist/` or `.env.local` to git.
  - Artifacts path `/opt/cursor/artifacts` may be full — use `/tmp` or GitHub Releases for large ZIPs.
